# 🚗 Road Accident Forecast in India (2016–2025)

This project combines Python and Power BI to analyze and forecast road accidents in India from 2016 to 2025. Historical accident data was processed in Excel, prediction modeling was performed using Python, and interactive dashboards were created in Power BI.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Forecast road accident trends in India
- **Data Source**: Government data (2016–2021)
- **Forecast Tool**: Python + Power BI
- **Key Highlight**: Predicted accident count in 2025 is around **3,00,000**

## 🔍 Key Insights

- A visible dip in 2020 due to COVID-19 lockdown
- Gradual recovery followed by a **forecasted decline** in accidents post-2021
- If current trends continue, accidents may fall below **3 lakh by 2025**

---

## 📈 Forecasting Model

- You can switch between **linear regression** and **polynomial regression (degree 2)** in the Python code
- Output predictions are shown as a new column and visualized in Power BI

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Python Code

```bash
# Step 1: Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

# Step 2: Run the script
python road_accident_forecast.py

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add state-wise and city-wise accident prediction
- Integrate vehicle type and accident severity data
- Build an interactive web dashboard with Python (e.g., Streamlit)
- Automate real-time data updates using APIs
- Compare forecast models: Linear, Polynomial, ARIMA, etc.
